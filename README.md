# A meta-analysis investigating microbiome diversity and composition within sex

This repository contains the code and data for a meta-analysis investigating microbiome diversity and composition, specifically examining patterns within different sex in mice.


## Repository Structure 
The repository is organized as follows:
* **`R/`**: This directory contains the R script used to perform the meta-analysis.
* **`data/`**: This directory holds all the necessary data files to execute the R script. For ease of use, we recommend:
    * Loading the pre-processed R Object, which contains all required data in a single file. Alternatively, you can load the individual data files directly. 
* **`results/`**: This directory stores the output files generated from running the R script.
* **`custom_func/`**: This directory contains custom R functions used in the analysis. These functions will be loaded automatically by the main R script.
